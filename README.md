# Chrome Controller
##### An open source project that will allow you to control Google Chrome from your bed, couch, floor: really anywhere that isn't your desk using your Xbox / PlayStation ( and many other ) controllers!

###### Note: All buttons will be referred to in respect to the Xbox One Controller.

## Global Controls:
- RB/LB: Seeks forwards and backwards through history ( simulates pressing the back and forward arrows in the top left corner )
- RT/LT: Focuses the right / left tab respectively.
- Right Analog Stick: Uses the vertical axis to simulate scrolling up and down. Will also "sprint" ( increase scroll speed by a factor of 2 ) if you click the stick downwards while scrolling.
- Combination of Right & Left Analog Sticks: When pinching inwards or pulling outwards ( like you would on a smart phone ) the focused tab will zoom in and out.
- Select Button: Closes the current tab.
- Start Button: Opens a new tab default to the google search

## Youtube Controls:
- Left Analog Stick: Now with moving the left stick up and down you're able to select videos.
- A Button: After you have selected a video, if you press A that video will begin to play.
- X Button: If a video is playing, the X button will pause and play the video.
- Y Button: Holding Y will show the video "hud" that shows the remaining time & other menu buttons.
- B Button: Since YouTube's security doesn't allow for full screen toggling through code, the B button will toggle theater mode.
